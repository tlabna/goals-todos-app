# Goals Todos App #

The purpose of this project was to build a simple Goals/Todos app using **vanilla Javascript** and then refactored to use React, React Router and Redux.

The app before refactoring (i.e. without React + Redux) can be found at this [commit](https://github.com/tlabna/goals-todos-app/tree/21ba88714271e7cec29e58c6ff2423246af52c10)
